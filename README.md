### Exercise 2 - Create a markdown cell with the title of the notebook. (1 pt)

# Introduction to Data Science Notebooks

### Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction. (1 pt)

This notebook is an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks for data science. It covers the basics of Markdown cells, code cells, and various data science concepts.

### Exercise 4 - Create a markdown cell to list data science languages. (3 pts)
#### Some popular data science programming languages include:
- Python
- R
- Java 
- Scala
- SQL

### Exercise 5 - Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries. (3 pts)
 ####  Common data science libraries and frameworks include:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

### Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. (3 pts)  

  | Data Science Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Jupyter Notebook | Interactive coding environment |
| RStudio | Integrated development environment for R |
| Apache Spark | Distributed data processing engine |
| Tableau | Data visualization and business intelligence tool |
| Git | Version control system |

### Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)

#### In the following cells, we will demonstrate some basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Addition
- subtraction
- Multiplication.
- Division.

### Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers. (2 pts)
x = 5

y = 10


product = x * y


sum = x + y


print(f"The product of {x} and {y} is {product}")


print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {sum}")

### Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)
minutes = 120

 
hours = minutes / 60


print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")


### Objectives:
- Understand the basics of Jupyter Notebooks
- Learn how to create Markdown cells and Code cells
- Practice using common data science languages and libraries
- Explore basic arithmetic operations in Python
